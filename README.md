# PIC32-Tetris

(One-y and a two-ey and a three and four) 
Shapes made of four colored blocks like a T or a box come down like falling bricks 
You can place them in rows, but everybody knows that they made this game for chicks (HEY!) 

Mom just loves to flip and stack 
Grandma says this shit is like crack! (Well it is!) 

This is the game girls deserve, there is no learning curve 
Which makes it great for noobs (grrreat for noobs!) 
It will fill you with glee, especially if you have a vaj and boobs (HEY!) 

Your mom loves it, mine does too (mine does too) 
Call me sexist, bitch it's still true (just kidding about the bitch part) 

Deep in a girl's dainty brain, there's a spot near a vein (Right here) 
Which regulates their bliss (The T-spot) 
Once they see falling blocks, the T-spot unlocks 
And they start to sing like this (SING!) 

LA LA LA LA LA LA LA 
WE LOVE TETRIS, LA LA LA LA 

Here is a trick I have learned 
To avoid getting burned 
When you piss off your chick (I'm so mad!) 

If you sing this on key, 
Immediately she'll forget that you're a dick (Try it!) 

LA LA LA LA (I'm still mad.) LA LA LA (Is that the Tetris song?) 
LA LA LA LA (I love Tetris!) LA LA LA (I'm happy now!) 

Tetris helps when chicks want to neuter us (Snip, snip, snip) 
If you love it, you probably have a uterus!
